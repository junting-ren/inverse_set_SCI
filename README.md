This is the code repo for the paper: Inverse Set Estimation and Inversion of Simultaneous Confidence Intervals, by Junting Ren, Fabian J.E. Telschow, Armin Schwartzman

Abstract: Motivated by the questions of risk assessment in climatology (temperature change in North America) and medicine (impact of statin usage and COVID-19 on hospitalized patients), we address the problem of estimating the set in the domain of a function whose image equals a predefined subset. Existing methods require strict assumptions. We generalize the estimation of such sets to dense and non-dense domains with protection against inflated Type I error in exploratory data analysis. This is achieved by proving that confidence sets of multiple upper, lower or interval sets can be simultaneously constructed with the desired confidence non-asymptotically through inverting simultaneous confidence intervals. Non-parametric bootstrap algorithm and code are provided.
